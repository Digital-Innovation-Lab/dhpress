DHPress is a flexible, repurposable, fully extensible digital public humanities toolkit designed for non-technical users.

== Description ==

The digital public humanities toolkit, DH Press is built on the WordPress platform and its plugin-based architecture.

DH Press is a plugin for WordPress that enables scholars to visualize their humanities-oriented data and allow users to access that data from the visualizations themselves. The graphical representation of data – whether it be geographical information shown on maps, temporal data shown on timelines, family relationships shown on trees, etc. – can facilitate users in comprehending it quickly and analyzing it in domain-specific ways. WordPress’s plugin architecture allows for open and unlimited enhancement of features and functionalities. DH Press also supplies widgets that can display and coordinate textual transcripts with SoundCloud audio or YouTube video playback.

Building DH Press on WordPress offers the following important benefits: 
	1) its CMS provides a stable and robust core, 
	2) it allows us to tap into a broad community of developers and users and to contribute new plugins to the WordPress community, and 
	3) it facilities agile development through plugin modification. 
	
Thus, building DH Press on top of the WordPress CMS results in a truly sustainable, open-source, and extensible toolkit that can be used and re-used across the globe.
